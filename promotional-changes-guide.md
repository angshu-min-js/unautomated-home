## Step-by-Step Reversion Instructions

### Step 1: Update Pricing Section
1. **Open:** `unautomated-home/index.html`
2. **Find:** The pricing section around line 560-570 (search for "Upgrade to detailed report")
3. **Replace:** The current promotional text with the simple "$5" text
4. **Result:** Users will see "Upgrade to detailed report for $5" without strikethrough or FREE badge

### Step 2: Update How It Works - Step 3
1. **Open:** `unautomated-home/index.html`
2. **Find:** Step 3 in the "How It Works" section (search for "Get Detailed Report")
3. **Replace:** The complex promotional badge with the simple "Paid" badge
4. **Result:** Step 3 will show a yellow "Paid" badge instead of the promotional styling

### Step 3: Update App Configuration (If Needed)
**Note:** Ensure the app itself is configured to charge for detailed reports:

1. **Check:** Payment integration is enabled in the app
2. **Verify:** Detailed report generation requires payment processing
3. **Test:** Complete user flow to ensure payment is required
